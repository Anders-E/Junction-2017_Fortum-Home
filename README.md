# Junction2017 - Fortum Challenge - Smart Electricity

#### A project by:

- Anders Eriksson *(Computer Science & Engineering)*
- Simon Johansson Nyberg *(Engineering Physics)*
- Johan Skrealid *(Energy Systems Engineering)*

### Challenge Description:
Can new services be developed utilizing the power consumption data your energy company regularly measures?

#### Our ideas for new services: 

‘Home Status’ & ‘Smart home notifications’ app-extension   

##### Product description: 

**Home Status:** - Based off your normal power consumption pattern the Home Status extension will continually display which out of two states your home(s) currently is in;

*Sleep mode:* - When next to no power-related activity is taking place, apart from basic heating, your home status on the app will be showing the “Sleep mode” status.

*Active:* - If the lights have been turned on and you are spending leisure time with the tv, radio or computer, resulting in a slight uptick in your power consumption, your home will be flagged “Active”.


***Smart home notifications***
Status changes happening while you are absent results in a push notification (*"Your home is active"*), allowing the owner to know when their children come home from school or when the relatives arrives in the winter cabin.

Prolonged usage of a power-intensive appliance causes a push notification of reminding you of its use (*"Are you making slow cooked beef tenderloin or is it time to turn off the oven?"*)

Building upon the idea of certain appliances power usage being destinct a home-owner could personalise his/her house-profile by labeling the tycally intensive appliances (Oven, sauna, iron, dishwasher). This would enable reminders for things that need to be shut off or allow the exclude the dishwasher to get a clearer picture of what    

Data collection -> Help us learn about power consumption while working towards smart home solutions, what powerconsuming appliance did you just turn on? 
 
homes solutions. (Enable smarthome mode => push notification whenever a large power consumption is initatied, asking which kind of appliance was activated)
