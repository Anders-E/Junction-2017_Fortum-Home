# Junction2017 - Fortum Challenge - Smart Electricity

#### A project by:

- Anders Eriksson *(Computer Science & Engineering)*
- Simon Johansson Nyberg *(Engineering Physics)*
- Johan Skrealid *(Energy Systems Engineering)*

### Challenge Description:
Can new services be developed utilizing the power consumption data your energy company regularly measures?

#### Our ideas for new services: 

‘Home Status’ & ‘Smart home notifications’ app-extension   

##### Product description: 

**Home Status:** - Based off the normal power consumption patterns in your home the Home Status extension will continually show in which state your home(s) currently are;

*Rest:* - When next to no power-related activity is taking place in your home, apart from basic heating, your home status on the app will be showing the “Sleep” status.

*Active:* - If the lights have been turned on and you are spending leisure time with the tv, radio or television resulting in a slight uptick in your power consumption, your home will be flagged “Active”.


***Smart home notifications***
Data collection -> Help us learn about power consumption while working towards smart home solutions, what powerconsuming appliance did you just turn on? 

Push notifications -> *Winter house* is now active 
(After the grandkids arrive at the winter house or get home from school?)

Privacy smarthome tradeoff – Consumers can voluntarily contribute data which works toward smart 
homes solutions. (Enable smarthome mode => push notification whenever a large power consumption is initatied, asking which kind of appliance was activated)
